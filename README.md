Recipe Hub: A Simple Recipe Website

Welcome to Recipe Hub! This is a clean and easy-to-use website project designed to showcase a curated collection of recipes. It's built entirely with HTML and CSS, making it a perfect example of fundamental web development skills.

The goal of this site is to provide users with a straightforward way to browse recipes based on their dietary preferences and to suggest new ideas for the collection.

✨ Features

This website includes several key features:

1. Three Dietary Options
To make browsing simple, all recipes are organized into three main categories. Users can immediately navigate to the section that fits their lifestyle:

🥦 Vegetarian:** Dishes without meat or fish.
🍗 Non-Vegetarian:** A selection of meat, poultry, and fish-based meals.
🥑 Vegan:** Recipes made entirely without animal products.

2. Curated Recipe List
Each of the three dietary categories (Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, and Vegan) features **three distinct dishes**. This curated list provides users with great ideas without overwhelming them with choices.

3. User Feedback Form
We want to hear from you! A feedback form is included at the bottom of the page. This allows users to:

* Suggest new recipes or dishes they would like to see added.
* Provide general feedback on the website.


🛠️ Technology Stack
