    <pre>Here is a short and easy butter chicken recipe that you can make in about 30 minutes.

⏱️ Quick Butter Chicken (Approx. 30 Mins)
This recipe is a simplified, one-pan version that delivers that classic creamy, tangy flavor without a long marinade or complex steps.

Ingredients
Chicken:

1 lb (about 2) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces

1/2 cup plain yogurt (Greek or regular)

1 tbsp lemon juice

1 tsp ginger-garlic paste (or 1 clove garlic & 1 tsp grated ginger)

1 tsp garam masala

1/2 tsp turmeric

1/2 tsp kashmiri chili powder (or paprika)

1/2 tsp salt

Sauce:

2 tbsp butter

1 tbsp oil (to prevent butter from burning)

1 small onion, finely chopped

1 tsp ginger-garlic paste

1 (15 oz) can of crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce

1 tsp garam masala

1 tsp sugar (to balance the tomato)

1/2 tsp salt

1/2 cup heavy cream

To Finish: 1 tbsp butter & chopped cilantro (optional)

Instructions
Quick Marinate: In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with all the marinade ingredients (yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, and salt). Set aside for 10 minutes while you start the sauce.

Start Sauce & Cook Chicken: In a large pan or pot, melt the 2 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until soft.

Cook Chicken: Add the marinated chicken to the pan (it's okay to add the marinade with it). Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is mostly cooked through and lightly browned.

Finish Sauce: Add the remaining 1 tsp ginger-garlic paste and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, 1 tsp garam masala, sugar, and 1/2 tsp salt.

Simmer: Bring the sauce to a simmer, then lower the heat. Let it bubble gently for 10 minutes for the flavors to meld.

Add Cream & Butter: Stir in the heavy cream and the final 1 tbsp of butter. Let it heat through for 1-2 minutes (do not let it boil).

Serve hot, garnished with cilantro, alongside basmati rice or naan.</pre>
