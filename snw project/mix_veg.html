    <pre>This recipe makes a creamy, mild curry in about 15 minutes.

Total Time: 15 minutes Servings: 2-3

Ingredients
Oil: 1 tbsp (like coconut, vegetable, or canola oil)

Aromatics:

1 small onion, chopped

1-2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tsp ginger, grated or minced (optional)

Spices:

1-2 tbsp curry powder (use mild or hot to your taste)

½ tsp turmeric powder

Vegetables: 2-3 cups frozen mixed vegetables (a mix of peas, carrots, corn, and green beans is classic)

Curry Base:

1 can (13.5 oz / 400ml) coconut milk

½ cup vegetable broth or water

1 tbsp tomato paste (optional, for depth)

To Finish:

Salt and pepper, to taste

A squeeze of lime or lemon juice

Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)

Instructions
Sauté Aromatics: Heat the oil in a medium pot or saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until it starts to soften. Add the garlic and ginger (if using) and cook for 1 more minute until fragrant.

Bloom Spices: Add the curry powder and turmeric. Stir constantly for 30 seconds until the spices are toasted and fragrant.

Simmer Curry: Pour in the coconut milk, vegetable broth (or water), and tomato paste (if using). Whisk everything together and bring to a gentle simmer.

Cook Veggies: Add the frozen mixed vegetables directly to the pot. Stir to combine, and let the curry simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are heated through and tender.

Finish & Serve: Turn off the heat. Stir in a squeeze of lime or lemon juice, and add salt and pepper to your taste. Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, over rice or with naan bread.</pre>
