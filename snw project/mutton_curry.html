    <pre>⏱️ Quick Pressure Cooker Mutton Curry
This recipe is a straightforward, one-pot method that makes the mutton tender and flavorful in under an hour.

Ingredients
Mutton: 500g, bone-in, cut into curry pieces

For the Base:

3 tbsp Oil (mustard oil or any cooking oil)

2 large Onions, thinly sliced

1 tbsp Ginger-Garlic Paste

2 medium Tomatoes, finely chopped or puréed

Whole Spices (Optional, but recommended):

1 Bay Leaf

1 inch Cinnamon Stick

2-3 Green Cardamoms

2-3 Cloves

Powdered Spices:

1 tsp Kashmiri Red Chili Powder (for color)

1/2 tsp Turmeric Powder

1 tsp Coriander Powder

1/2 tsp Cumin Powder

1/2 tsp Garam Masala

Other:

1/2 cup Plain Yogurt (curd), whisked (optional, for richness)

1-2 Green Chilies, slit

Salt to taste

1.5 cups Hot Water

Chopped Coriander leaves for garnish

Instructions
Sauté Onions: Heat the oil in your pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add the whole spices and let them sizzle for 30 seconds. Add the sliced onions and fry until they are soft and golden brown (about 8-10 minutes).

Add Aromatics: Add the ginger-garlic paste and the slit green chilies. Sauté for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell is gone.

Bhuna Masala: Add the powdered spices (chili, turmeric, coriander, cumin) and a splash of water. Fry for 1-2 minutes until the oil starts to separate from the masala.

Add Mutton & Tomatoes: Add the mutton pieces and salt. Sauté on high heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring well to sear the meat and coat it in the masala. Add the chopped tomatoes (and yogurt, if using) and cook for another 5 minutes until the tomatoes break down.

Pressure Cook: Add 1.5 cups of hot water and stir well. Secure the lid of the pressure cooker. Cook on high heat until the first whistle, then lower the heat and cook for another 15-20 minutes (or about 4-5 whistles).

Finish: Let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid, stir in the 1/2 tsp of garam masala, and garnish with fresh coriander.

Serve hot with rice or naan.</pre>
