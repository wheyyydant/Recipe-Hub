Quick Palak Paneer Recipe
This recipe gives you a vibrant, creamy spinach curry with soft paneer cubes.

Yields: 2-3 servings Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 20 minutes

Ingredients
For the Spinach Purée:

1 large bunch spinach (approx. 250g)

1-2 green chilies (adjust to your spice level)

1-inch piece of ginger

2-3 cloves of garlic

For the Curry:

200g paneer, cut into cubes

2 tbsp oil or ghee

1 tsp cumin seeds

1 large onion, finely chopped

1 large tomato, finely chopped or puréed

¼ tsp turmeric powder

½ tsp coriander powder

½ tsp garam masala

2-3 tbsp heavy cream (or milk)

Salt to taste

½ tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crushed (optional)

Instructions
Blanch & Purée Spinach:

Boil a pot of water. Add the spinach and blanch for 2-3 minutes until wilted.

Immediately transfer the spinach to a bowl of ice-cold water (this keeps the green color).

Drain the spinach and add it to a blender with the green chilies, ginger, and garlic. Blend to a smooth purée.

Prepare Paneer (Optional):

In a pan, heat 1 tsp of oil and lightly fry the paneer cubes until golden brown on all sides. Set aside. (This step prevents the paneer from crumbling, but you can also add it raw).

Make the Gravy:

In the same pan, heat the remaining oil/ghee. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.

Add the chopped onion and sauté until it turns soft and light golden (about 5-7 minutes).

Add the chopped tomato (or purée). Cook until it becomes soft and oil starts to separate from the masala.

Add Spices:

Lower the heat and add the turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.

Combine & Finish:

Pour in the spinach purée. Mix well and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the paneer cubes, garam masala, and cream. Stir to combine.

Simmer for another 2-3 minutes. If the gravy is too thick, add a splash of water.

Stir in the optional crushed kasuri methi, turn off the heat, and serve hot.</pre>
