    <pre>🐟 Quick Fish Pakora
This recipe uses a double-flour (besan + rice flour) batter for an extra crispy finish. It's perfect as a snack or appetizer and takes about 20-25 minutes.

Ingredients
Fish: 250g boneless white fish (like Cod, Basa, or Tilapia), cut into 1-inch cubes

For the Batter:

1/2 cup Gram Flour (Besan)

2 tbsp Rice Flour (or Cornstarch) - This is the secret to making them crispy!

1 tsp Ginger-Garlic Paste

1/2 tsp Kashmiri Red Chili Powder (or paprika, for color)

1/2 tsp Garam Masala

1/2 tsp Ajwain (Carom Seeds) - Highly recommended for the classic flavor

1/4 tsp Turmeric Powder

1/2 tsp Salt (or to taste)

1 tbsp Lemon Juice

Approx. 1/4 cup Water (add slowly)

For Frying: Oil (Vegetable, Canola, etc.)

Instructions
Pat Dry Fish: Use a paper towel to pat the fish pieces completely dry. This helps the batter stick and prevents a soggy pakora.

Make Batter: In a medium bowl, combine all the batter ingredients except the water and fish. Mix the flours and spices well.

Create a Paste: Add the lemon juice and then add water 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until you have a thick, spoon-coatable paste (like the consistency of thick pancake batter). Do not make it thin or runny.

Coat Fish: Add the dry fish pieces to the bowl and gently toss to coat each piece evenly in the thick batter.

Fry the Pakoras:

Heat about 2 inches of oil in a kadai or deep pan over medium-high heat.

Once hot (a drop of batter should sizzle and rise), gently add the battered fish pieces one by one.

Do not overcrowd the pan. Fry in 2-3 small batches.

Fry for 3-5 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are deep golden brown and crispy.

Drain & Serve: Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack (preferred for crispiness) or a paper towel.

Sprinkle with a little chaat masala and serve immediately with green chutney or lemon wedges.</pre>
