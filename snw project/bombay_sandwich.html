    <pre>Here is a quick and easy recipe for a classic Bombay Sandwich, a popular street food from Mumbai.

The "quick" secret to this sandwich is having two components ready beforehand: the boiled potato and the green chutney. The assembly itself takes only minutes.

ingredients
Essential Components:

Bread: 8 slices of white bread (the traditional choice)

Butter: Softened, for spreading

Green Chutney: (Recipe below or use store-bought)

Boiled Potato: 1 large, peeled and thinly sliced

Cucumber: 1 medium, thinly sliced

Tomato: 1 large, ripe but firm, thinly sliced

Onion: 1 small, thinly sliced

Chaat Masala: (or Sandwich Masala) for sprinkling

Optional Add-ins:

Boiled Beetroot: 1 small, peeled and thinly sliced

Cheese Slices: For a grilled cheese version

Sev (crispy chickpea noodles): For garnish

Quick Green Chutney (Make-Ahead)
If you don't have this on hand, you can make a quick batch by blending:

1 cup fresh cilantro (coriander leaves)

½ cup fresh mint leaves

1-2 green chilies (to your taste)

½ inch ginger

1 tbsp lemon juice

A pinch of salt and sugar

A tiny splash of water to help it blend

5-Minute Assembly Instructions
This recipe makes 4 sandwiches.

Prep the Bread: Lay out all 8 slices of bread. Generously spread softened butter on one side of each slice. This prevents the bread from getting soggy.

Spread the Chutney: On the buttered side of 4 slices, spread a layer of green chutney.

Layer the Veggies: On top of the chutney slices, begin layering your vegetables. A popular order is:

Boiled Potato slices

Cucumber slices

Tomato slices

Onion slices

(and Beetroot, if using)

Sprinkle the Magic: After each vegetable layer (or at least on top of all of them), sprinkle a generous pinch of chaat masala. This is the key to the authentic flavor.

Close the Sandwich: Place the remaining 4 buttered slices (butter-side down) on top to close the sandwiches.

Serve: Press the sandwich down gently. You can slice off the crusts (the street-style way) and cut the sandwich into halves or quarters.</pre>
